# Steps to Run the App
No special needs to run the app.

# Focus Areas:
Setting up a good base level architecture. I like building things for easy expandability. I also previously spent too much time finding REST API paths so I built the networking layer to prevent that time waste.

# Time Spent:
Probably about 10 hours. I spent some time learning the Swift 5.5 changes. I also struggled with AsyncImage caching, despite following multiple guides on how to do it, I ended up having to use CachedAsyncImage.

# Trade-offs and Decisions:
The UI is not as clean as I would like, but I found out about some List animation limitations and don't want to spend too much time working around those limitations. In hindsight I would either build a custom List or use something more like a table or more animation friendly.

# Weakest Part of the Project:
Unit tests. I know how to write them, I just have trouble knowing everything that needs to be unit tested.

# External Code and Dependencies:
CachedAsyncImage

# Additional Information:
No additional information
